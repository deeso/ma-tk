# Memory Analysis Framework

This is a basic framework for working with raw dumps 
and memory in Python.  I have re-written this code 
several times on several occasions.  Its time to make
it an official repo so that I can focu on other stuff.

As I use it, Ill make updates and add useful features.


### Shortcomings
1. Does not read across memory region boundaries.
